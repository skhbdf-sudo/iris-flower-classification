# iris-flower-classification
A machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using Logistic Regression. The model uses feature scaling (StandardScaler) and is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Key Features
Uses the built-in Iris dataset from Scikit-learn
Feature scaling with StandardScaler for better model performance
Classification using Logistic Regression
Train–test data split for unbiased evaluation
Model evaluation using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report

Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib & Seaborn
